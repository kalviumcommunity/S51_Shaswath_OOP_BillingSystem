# Billing System



## The Billing System project is a console-based application designed to simulate a billing process for items purchased by a customer. It allows users to enter customer details and item information, dynamically generate invoices, and display the total amount after discounts. This project helps in understanding and applying fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++.

## Key Features:

### Input customer details (name and phone number).
### Input item details (ID, name, price, and discount).
### Display a detailed invoice with all items and the total amount.
### Edit item details if necessary.
